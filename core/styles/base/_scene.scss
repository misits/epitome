/* Scene Transitions and Animations
 * This file provides styles for scene transitions in the SPA engine
 * The animation system uses classes:
 * - .transitioning - Applied to container during transition
 * - .active - Applied to container when active with animations
 * - .no-animation - Applied to container when animations are disabled
 */

// Main app container - starts hidden and becomes visible
#app-container {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  
  &.active {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  
  &.no-animation {
    opacity: 1;
    transition: none;
  }
  
  &.transitioning {
    pointer-events: none; // Prevents clicks during transition
  }
}

// Scene content - always visible
.scene-content {
  opacity: 1;
  width: 100%;
}
