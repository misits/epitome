/* Scene Transitions and Animations
 * This file provides styles for scene transitions in the SPA engine
 * The animation system uses classes:
 * - .transitioning - Applied to container during transition
 * - .active - Applied to container when active with animations
 * - .no-animation - Applied to container when animations are disabled
 */

// Main app container - starts hidden and becomes visible
#app-container {
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 450ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);

  visibility: visible;
  
  // Active state - fully visible
  &.active {
    opacity: 1;
    transition: opacity 450ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);
  }
  
  // No animation state - immediately visible
  &.no-animation {
    opacity: 1 !important; // Override any other opacity settings
    transition: none !important;
    
    // Also ensure that nested content is immediately visible
